# Tender
A playful nod to the dating app Tinder. Tender is lightweight, interactive voting room app designed to help friends choose a restaurant together.

### Vision
Just like *Tinder* helps people match with potential dates by swiping, *Tender* helps groups of friends “match” with restaurants by swiping on local food spots. Our goal is simple: Less time deciding, more time connecting.

### Motivation
 Trying to decide where to eat can be a daunting task for individuals or groups. We want to make that task a little more fun by serving you local restaurants and all you have to do is swipe to decide!

> I had been thinking about this idea for some time, and a project in our CU Boulder web development course gave me the opportunity to bring it to life with a great team. Everyone brought unique strengths that helped shape the first version of Tender. You can find the original team repository here: [link coming soon].
> This version is a personal continuation. I’ve cleaned up the codebase, removed course-specific files, and plan to keep building on it.

### Product Description
Tender is a web-based app where users log in with a group of people (or just one friend) and are shown cards featuring local restaurants in their area. Each member swipes left for "yum" or right for "gross" on each restaurant. After everyone has voted, the app calculates scores and recommends a selection for the group.

### Acknowledgments
This app started as a group project at CU Boulder in our web development course. The original version was built with a great team of classmates who helped turn this silly idea into something real. While this version is a personal continuation, I’m grateful for my teammates’ contributions and for making the process genuinely fun to be part of.
